Researchers successfully implanted pig hearts into baboons, and two of the recipients lived for six months before being euthanized, reports Scientific American. Writing in Nature, the researchers from Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland call the development a \"milestone\" for cross-species heart transplants, or cardiac xenotransplantation. A pig-to-baboon heart transplant had previously worked for 57 days, though that was just in a single case, per the Guardian. The development further raises the possibility that pig hearts could someday work in humans, perhaps putting an end to donor waiting lists, though much research is needed before that could happen. One hurdle scientists would have to overcome: ensuring that pig hearts didn't transmit pig viruses into humans, explains Nature in a separate article on the development.
