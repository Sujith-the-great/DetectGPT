{"original": ["Question: Is an advance care planning model feasible in community palliative care? Answer: An advance care planning model is feasible for community palliative care services. Quality audit processes are an essential component of the Model with documentation of advance care planning discussion established as an important outcome measure.", "Question: Is coeliac disease screening in risk groups justified? Answer: Long-term dietary compliance in screen-detected patients was good. Quality of life and bone mineral density were comparable with those in non-coeliac subjects and the general population. Active screening in coeliac disease risk groups seems to be reasonable rather than harmful.", "Question: Does blood pressure change in treated hypertensive patients depending on whether it is measured by a physician or a nurse? Answer: Systolic BP measured by the nurse in treated hypertensive patients is significantly lower than the readings obtained by the physician, and are almost identical to ambulatory BP monitoring. Blood pressure determination by the nurse is desirable not only for diagnosis", "Question: Metastatic carcinoma to the cervical nodes from an unknown head and neck primary site: Is there a need for neck dissection? Answer: In our experience, definitive radiotherapy to the neck and the potential mucosal sites, whether preceded by neck dissection or not, is effective to achieve a good local control rate in the unknown primary cancer of the head and neck. The indication for neck dissection, in particular for early nodal stage, is controversial.", "Question: Estimation of basal metabolic rate in Chinese: are the current prediction equations applicable? Answer: To date, the newly developed Singapore equation is the most accurate BMR prediction equation in Chinese and is applicable", "Question: Recovery Outcome Measures: Is There a Place for Culture, Attitudes, and Faith? Answer: This paper discusses the cultural appropriateness of the RAQ in Australian settings, and identifies the need to develop rigorous, inclusive recovery outcome measures.", "Question: Thoracic and thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair: is reimplantation of spinal cord arteries a waste of time? Answer: With monitoring of MEP and SSEP, sacrifice--without reimplantation--of as many as 15 intercostal and lumbar arteries during TAA/A repair is safe, resulting in acceptably low rates of immediate and delayed paraplegia. This experience suggests that routine surgical implantation of segmental vessels is not indicated, and that, with evolving understanding of spinal cord perfusion, endovascular repair of the entire thoracic aorta should ultimately be possible without spinal cord injury.", "Question: Are sports medicine journals relevant and applicable to practitioners and athletes? Answer: There is a dearth of studies addressing diagnostic and treatment interventions in the sports medicine literature. The evidence base for sports medicine must continue to increase in terms of volume and quality.", "Question: Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN): a role for polymorphisms in the beta-adrenergic receptor (ADRB) encoding genes? Answer: We conclude that beta1Gly49 homozygosity and TACC haplotype of ADRB2 gene, both loss-of-function genetic variations, may predispose to TTN.", "Question: Hepatorenal syndrome: are we missing some prognostic factors? Answer: We report for the first time ESLD etiology as a prognostic factor for survival. The renal function (expressed as serum creatinine) and urinary Na (<5 mEq/l) at the time of diagnosis were found to be associated with survival, suggesting that early treatment might increase survival.", "Question: Does glomerular hyperfiltration in pregnancy damage the kidney in women with more parities? Answer: In our study, we suggest that glomerular hyperfiltration due to pregnancy does not have adverse effects on kidney in women with more parities. Pregnancy may have possible protective mechanisms for kidney against adverse effects of glomerular hyperfiltration.", "Question: Is high-sensitivity C-reactive protein associated with carotid atherosclerosis in healthy Koreans? Answer: Both hsCRP levels and the carotid IMT were strongly correlated with conventional cardiovascular risk factors, but there was no independent association between hsCRP levels and carotid IMT in healthy Korean adults.", "Question: Does cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures? Answer: The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We", "Question: Are opioid dependence and methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) documented in the medical record? Answer: Among patients receiving MMT and medical care at different sites, documentation of opioid dependence and MMT in the medical record occurs for the majority, but is missing in a substantial number of patients. Most of these patients are prescribed medications that potentially interact with methadone. This study highlights opportunities for improved coordination between medical care and MMT.", "Question: Do symptoms matter when considering patients for phase I clinical trials? Answer: Older adults enrolled in PICT with more symptoms may sacrifice QOL for experimental treatment.", "Question: Is expert breast pathology assessment necessary for the management of ductal carcinoma in situ ? Answer: Expert breast pathology assessments continue to be necessary in the management of DCIS.", "Question: Is endometrial polyp formation associated with increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and transforming growth factor-beta1? Answer: There was increased expression of TGF-\u03b21 and VEGF in polyps compared to adjacent normal endometrial tissue. It suggested that these cytokines might play a role in endometrial polyp formation. In addition, there was a significant correlation between steroid receptor expression and VEGF and TGF-\u03b21 expression.", "Question: Preparing patients at high risk of falls for discharge home after rehabilitation: Do we meet the guidelines? Answer: There was little evidence that people at high risk of falls received systematic falls risk assessment during rehabilitation. When a risk was identified, generally a strategy was implemented. However, failure to assess some risk factors might have limited fall prevention strategies offered. Failure to adequately address risks during hospitalization could contribute to falls post-discharge. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 570-576.", "Question: Could the extent of lymphadenectomy be modified by neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cervical cancer? Answer: The frequency and topographic distribution of LNM are not modified by NACT, and clinical non-responders showed more involved LNs. A systemic and extensive lymphadenectomy should be performed in patients treated with NACT plus surgery regardless of the response to NACT.", "Question: Does the lipid-lowering peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ligand bezafibrate prevent colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease? Answer: Our data, derived from patients with coronary artery disease, support the hypothesis regarding a possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer.", "Question: Does head positioning influence anterior chamber depth in pseudoexfoliation syndrome? Answer: In patients with clinically apparent unilateral pseudoexfoliation, the lens seems to be more mobile in the affected eye. This results in a shallower anterior chamber when the head is placed in a prone position. Whether this fact might potentially lead to transient pupillary block when engaging in activities such as facing down while reading warrants further study.", "Question: Does case-mix based reimbursement stimulate the development of process-oriented care delivery? Answer: This study demonstrates that hospital management can stimulate the development of care programmes by the adoption of case-mix reimbursement within hospitals' budgeting processes. Future research is recommended to confirm this finding and to determine whether the establishment of care programmes will in time indeed lead to a more process-oriented view of professionals.", "Question: Does sex influence the response to intravenous thrombolysis in ischemic stroke? Answer: Data from Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register suggest that intravenous thrombolysis may modify the observed survival and recovery advantage for men expected in the natural course of an ischemic stroke, with a possible larger beneficial treatment effect in women when compared with men.", "Question: 30-Day and 1-year mortality in emergency general surgery laparotomies: an area of concern and need for improvement? Answer: Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.", "Question: Can computerised tomography replace bone scintigraphy in detecting bone metastases from breast cancer? Answer: Our findings suggest routine BS of patients presenting with MBC is not required if CT (thorax, abdomen, and pelvis) is performed.", "Question: Diffusion-weighted echo-planar MR imaging of primary parotid gland tumors: is a prediction of different histologic subtypes possible? Answer: epiDWI has the potential to differentiate pleomorphic adenoma and myoepithelial adenomas from all other examined entities. Due to an overlap not only within the group of benign and malignant lesions but also between groups, diagnoses should not be addressed on the basis of ADC values solely. Therefore, further studies combining DWI, morphologic criteria, and probably other MR imaging techniques seem warranted.", "Question: Is cholecystectomy really an indication for concomitant splenectomy in mild hereditary spherocytosis? Answer: The advice to perform a concomitant splenectomy in children with mild HS undergoing cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones needs revisiting. In the era of minimal access surgery, the need for splenectomy in such children should be judged on its own merits.", "Question: Does menopausal transition affect the quality of life? Answer: This longitudinal study found no significant effect of menopausal transition on quality of life among Taiwanese women. The decline in the role limitations due to emotional problems was related to vasomotor symptoms.", "Question: Is aneurysm repair justified for the patients aged 80 or older after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage? Answer: Better prognosis was obtained when ruptured aneurysm was repaired in the elderly than it was treated conservatively. From the results of this study, we should not hesitate to offer the definitive surgery for the elderly with aSAH.", "Question: Sternal fracture in growing children : A rare and often overlooked fracture? Answer: Isolated sternal fractures in childhood are often due to typical age-related traumatic incidents.

Answer: Emergency DBE is feasible, safe and effective in acute OGIB and may avoid major surgery, diagnosing and successfully treating most patients. Combined approach with RT viewing by CE is especially useful to identify recurrent bleeding vascular lesions such as DL that may be easily misdiagnosed by non-emergency DBE.", "Question: Are physicians meeting the needs of family caregivers of the frail elderly? Answer: Hypotheses for this discontent are presented. Physicians may be uninterested in helping caregivers; even if they were receptive to counseling caregivers, they could be poorly remunerated for the types of counseling sessions that are usual for caregivers; and being a professional caregiver to family caregivers is demanding in itself.", "Question: Pap smears with glandular cell abnormalities: Are they detected by rapid prescreening? Answer: Pap smears with glandular cell abnormalities are often flagged as abnormal by RPS, and this results in a sensitivity of 36.4% (at the AGC threshold). Most importantly, some cases of AGC are detected on Pap smears by RPS only, and this demonstrates that RPS is a valuable QA method.", "Question: Does airway surgery lower serum lipid levels in obstructive sleep apnea patients? Answer: Surgery may improve blood lipid levels in patients with OSA, especially in patients with preoperative dyslipidemia, potentially yielding a", "Question: Is withdrawal-induced anxiety in alcoholism based on beta-endorphin deficiency?

Answer: The study data suggests a possible correlation between cervical discopathy and cervical MS plaque.", "Question: Aromatase inhibitor-related musculoskeletal symptoms: is preventing osteoporosis the key to eliminating these symptoms? Answer: Patients on AIs who develop osteoporosis are at increased risk of musculoskeletal symptoms and bone fracture. Comedication with Ca/Bis reduces the likelihood for osteoporosis and musculoskeletal symptoms. Patients who received tamoxifen before AIs were less likely to develop AI-related musculoskeletal symptoms. We recommend that patients on AIs should be offered Ca/Bis to reduce the incidence of musculoskeletal symptoms and fracture, especially if patients are receiving steroidal AI and/or did not receive tamoxifen before AIs.", "Question: Can D-dimer become a new diagnostic parameter for acute appendicitis? Answer: Increased D-dimer levels should not be considered as a diagnostic parameter in diagnosis of acute appendicitis.", "Question: Does automatic transmission improve driving behavior in older drivers?

Answer: In male HIV-infected patients older than 52 years and with at least two other CRFs, screening for SMI using myocardial SPECT was about four times more likely to be positive than in the general population. This may motivate physicians to advise these patients to undergo more systematic screening for SMI using this technique.", "Question: Does a preoperative medically supervised weight loss program improve bariatric surgery outcomes? Answer: MSWM does not appear to confer additional benefit as compared to the standard preoperative bariatric surgery protocol in terms of weight loss and most behavioral outcomes after LAGB in our patient population.", "Question: Do Indigenous Australians age prematurely? Answer: The idea that Indigenous people age prematurely is not well supported by this study of a series of discrete conditions. The current focus and type of services provided by the aged care sector may not be the best way to respond to the excessive burden of chronic disease and disability of middle-aged Indigenous people.", "Question: Do French lay people and health professionals find it acceptable to breach confidentiality to protect a patient's wife from a sexually transmitted disease? Answer: Most people in France are influenced by situational factors when deciding if a physician should breach confidentiality to protect the spouse of a patient infected with STD.", "Question: Fragility of the esophageal mucosa: a pathognomonic endoscopic sign of primary eosinophilic esophagitis? Answer: Primary eosinophilic esophagitis is characterized by fragile esophageal mucosa that readily tears in response to minor trauma during otherwise uneventful diagnostic endoscopy. This \"cr\u00eape-paper\" sign may alert endoscopists to the presence of the disease when other mucosal alterations are lacking. Dilation is effective for patients with symptoms with minimal morbidity, despite development of disquieting lesions in response", "Question: Are stroke patients' reports of home blood pressure readings reliable? Answer: This group of elderly stroke patients were able to record their BPs reliably at home. Any bias was small and would be unlikely to affect management. Since BP readings in a GP surgery are often a poor indication of true BP,", "Question: Is the first urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) in women with suspected preeclampsia a prognostic factor for maternal and neonatal adverse outcome? Answer: ACR is an independent prognostic factor for maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes in suspected preeclampsia. ACR may be useful to inform risk predictions within a prognostic model.", "Question: A model of healing of Los Angeles grades C and D reflux oesophagitis: is there an optimal time of acid suppression for maximal healing? Answer: After 4 weeks' acid-suppressive therapy for LA grade C or D oesophagitis, successful healing appears to reach a threshold above which improvements are unlikely to be achieved despite an increase in number of hours with intragastric pH>4.", "Question: Is the ability to perform transurethral resection of the prostate influenced by the surgeon's previous experience? Answer: The senior urologist was capable of resecting four times more tissue per time unit than the more inexperienced surgeons. Therefore, a surgeon's experience may be important to reduce the risk of secondary TURP due to recurring adenomas or adenomas that were incompletely resected. However, the incidence of complications was the same between the three groups.", "Question: Cervical spine fractures in geriatric blunt trauma patients with low-energy mechanism: are clinical predictors adequate? Answer: Clinical predictors appear inadequate for the evaluation of the cervical spine in geriatric trauma patients with low-energy mechanism.", "Question: Can APC mutation analysis contribute to therapeutic decisions in familial adenomatous polyposis? Answer: As age at manifestation and course of the disease may be rather variable, even in carriers of identical germline mutations, therapeutic decisions should be based on colonoscopic findings in individual patients rather than on the site of mutation. However, in patients with mutations within codons 1445-1580, it may be advisable to postpone elective colectomy because desmoids may arise through surgical intervention.", "Question: Does a geriatric oncology consultation modify the cancer treatment plan for elderly patients? Answer: The geriatric oncology consultation led to a modification of the cancer treatment plan in more than one third of cases. Further studies are needed to determine whether these modifications improve the outcome of these older patients.", "Question: CYP2D6*4 allele and breast cancer risk: is there any association? Answer: A possible decreased transformation of procarcinogens by CYP2D6*4 poor metabolisers could result in a protective effect against carcinogens.", "Question: Does obstructive sleep apnea affect aerobic fitness? Answer: Overall, in a US Air Force population, OSA does not predict a decrease in aerobic fitness as measured by cycle ergometry. However, patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of greater than 20 have a statistically significant decrease in aerobic fitness compared to the normal population. This study demonstrates the effects of OSA on aerobic fitness. Further correlation of fitness testing results with", "Question: Does loss of consciousness predict neuropsychological decrements after concussion? Answer: The results of this study cast doubt on the importance of LOC as a predictor of neuropsychological test performance during the acute phase of recovery from mild traumatic brain injury. Neuropsychological testing procedures have been shown to be sensitive in measuring cognitive sequelae of mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in athletes. The failure of this study to find any relationship between LOC and neuropsychological functioning in a large", "Question: Does early migraine treatment shorten time to headache peak and reduce its severity? Answer: Early treatment and use of triptans may lead to shorter duration from migraine headache onset to its peak but did not alleviate headache severity at peak. This could result in decreased migraine burden by reducing total migraine headache duration.", "Question: Living in an urban environment and non-communicable disease risk in Thailand: Does timing matter? Answer: Urbanicity was associated with increases in behavioral and physiological risk factors. However, these associations may not translate directly into increases in biological risk factors. It is likely that these biological risk factors were results of a complex interaction between both long term accumulation of exposure and early life exposures.", "Question: Marital status, living arrangement and mortality: does the association vary by gender? Answer: Evaluation of living arrangements is crucial for identifying and explaining gender differences in mortality risks by marital status. The impact of living alone and living with a partner seems to be different in men and women.", "Question: Major depression and alcohol use disorder in adolescence: Does comorbidity lead to poorer outcomes of depression? Answer: The results of these analyses suggest that marginally higher rates of depression to age 35 amongst the comorbid MD/AUD group were explained by increased exposure to adverse childhood circumstances amongst members of the comorbid group. Adolescent MD/AUD comorbidity is likely to be a risk marker, rather than a causal factor in subsequent MD.", "Question: Stretch-sensitive KCNQ1 mutation A link between genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation? Answer: These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.", "Question: Do we need imaging to diagnose appendicitis in children? Answer: Clinical assessment is the key to diagnose appendicitis. Nevertheless, in girls older than 10 years, selected use of imaging should be implemented to avoid unnecessary appendectomies. Imaging of choice in equivocal cases should be ultrasonography.", "Question: Do resident's leadership skills relate to ratings of technical skill? Answer: General surgery research residents' intraoperative leadership skills showed significant correlations to their perceptions of skill decay and task difficulty during a bowel repair. Evaluating resident's directional instructions may provide an additional individualized intraoperative assessment metric. Further evaluation relating to operative performance outcomes is warranted.", "Question: Are higher rates of depression in women accounted for by differential symptom reporting? Answer: Men and women in this community sample reported similar patterns of depressive symptoms. No evidence that the presentation of depressive symptoms differs by gender was found.", "Question: Hypotension in patients with coronary disease: can profound hypotensive events cause myocardial ischaemic events? Answer: In patients with ischaemic heart disease and hypotension, symptomatic and silent ischaemia occurred in a temporally causal relation with hypotension, particularly for diastolic pressures, suggesting that patients with coronary disease may be susceptible to ischaemic events incurred as a result of low blood pressure caused by excessive hypotensive drug treatment.", "Question: Are laboratories reporting serum quantitative hCG results correctly? Answer: Many factors contribute to the erroneous reporting of hCG results, including (a) the complexity of hCG molecule and confusion of nomenclature on the various forms of hCG; (b) laboratory personnel's lack of", "Question: Antral follicle assessment as a tool for predicting outcome in IVF--is it a better predictor than age and FSH? Answer: In vitro fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than were age or follicle stimulated hormone. Antral follicle assessment may provide a marker for ovarian age that is distinct from chronological age or hormonal markers.", "Question: Is pain a clinically relevant problem in general adult psychiatry? Answer: We found evidence that pain can be a significant clinical problem in psychiatric patients which seems to be underestimated in psychiatry. The investigated patients in general adult psychiatry are characterized by specific risk factors different from clinical subpopulations of other disciplines.", "Question: Is Alveolar Macrophage Phagocytic Dysfunction in Children With Protracted Bacterial Bronchitis a Forerunner to Bronchiectasis? Answer: A reduced alveolar macrophage phagocytic host response to apoptotic cells or NTHi may contribute to neutrophilic inflammation and NTHi colonization in both PBB and bronchiectasis. Whether this mechanism also contributes to the progression of PBB to bronchiectasis remains unknown.", "Question: Discharging patients earlier from Winnipeg hospitals: does it adversely affect quality of care? Answer: Improving hospital efficiency by shortening length of stay does not appear to result in increased rates of readmission or numbers of physician visits within 30 days after discharge from hospital. Research is needed to identify optimal lengths of stay", "Question: Optimism and survival: does an optimistic outlook predict better survival at advanced ages? Answer: An optimistic outlook appears to be a significant predictor of survival among the oldest-old women. It may also be a significant predictor for men but the sample size is small.", "Question: Is grandmultiparity an independent risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes? Answer: Grandmultiparous women had increased maternal and neonatal morbidity, and neonatal mortality even after controlling for confounders, suggesting a need for closer observation than regular multiparous patients during labor and delivery.", "Question: Diagnostic characteristics of child bipolar I disorder: does the \"Treatment of Early Age Mania (team)\" sample generalize? Answer: Generalization of the RCT sample was supported, because only 7.8% of Phenomenology subjects did not fit the RCT criteria. Nevertheless, because the RCT subjects were more severely ill, it is unclear if treatment findings from the RCT will be applicable to children with less severe mania.", "Question: Do provider service networks result in lower expenditures compared with HMOs or primary care case management in Florida's Medicaid program? Answer: The Medicaid Demonstration in Florida appears to result in lower PMPM expenditures. Demonstration PSNs generated slightly greater reductions in expenditures compared to Demonstration HMOs. PSNs appear to be a promising", "Question: Is (18)F-FDG a surrogate tracer to measure tumor hypoxia? Answer: This study showed that FDG is not a good surrogate tracer for tumor hypoxia under either ambient or hypoxic conditions. Only specific hypoxia tracers should be used to measure tumor hypoxia.", "Question: Do viral infections have a role in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo? Answer: BPPV is associated with positive viral serology, particularly during certain months of the year, mainly in spring and autumn. Viral infection might promote BPPV attacks due to the development of vestibulopathy or induce secondary BPPV via viral infection-related neurolabyrinthitis.", "Question: Does the radiographic transition zone correlate with the level of aganglionosis on the specimen in Hirschsprung's disease? Answer: Correlation between level of radiographic transition zone on contrast enema and length of aganglionosis remains low. Systematic preoperative biopsy by coelioscopy or ombilical incision is mandatory.", "Question: Characterization of the gender dimorphism after injury and hemorrhagic shock: are hormonal differences responsible? Answer: The independent protective effect of female gender on multiple organ failure and nosocomial infection rates remains significant in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women when compared with similarly aged men. This is contrary to", "Question: Ultra high risk (UHR) for psychosis criteria: are there different levels of risk for transition to psychosis? Answer: Our data suggest that UHR intake criteria predict transition over 6 months in the order of Trait alone<APS<BLIPS. The fact that BLIPS patients are at the highest risk of transition over the short term is consistent with the \"early\" versus \"late\" prodrome model. It also indicates that particular clinical attention may need to be paid to BLIPS patients, especially early in the course of treatment.", "Question: Does angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 (ACE-1) gene polymorphism lead to chronic kidney disease among hypertensive patients? Answer: It is concluded that ACE-DD genotype may be a risk factor for the causation and development of chronic kidney failure among hypertensive patients.", "Question: Is there a first night effect on sleep bruxism? Answer: The results showed no overall first night effect on severity of RMMA frequency in young and healthy patients with SB. In clinical practice, one-night sleep recording may be sufficient for moderate-high frequency SB patients. However, low RMMA frequency in the first night could be confirmed by a second night based on the patient's medical and dental history.", "Question: Does Residency Selection Criteria Predict Performance in Orthopaedic Surgery Residency? Answer: We found that USMLE Step 2, number of honors in medical school clerkships, and AOA membership demonstrated the strongest correlations with resident performance. Our goal in analyzing these data was to provide residency programs at large a sense of which criteria may be \"high yield\" in ranking applicants by analyzing data from within our own pool of residents. Similar studies across a broader scope of programs are warranted to confirm applicability of our findings. The continually emerging complexities of the field of orthopaedic surgery lend increasing importance to future work on the appropriate selection and training of orthopaedic residents.", "Question: Do general practice characteristics influence uptake of an information technology (IT) innovation in primary care? Answer: The analyses show that structural characteristics of a practice are not associated with uptake of a new IT facility, but that its use may be influenced by post-graduate education in the relevant clinical condition. For this diabetes system at least, practice nurse use was critical in spreading uptake beyond initial GP enthusiasts and for sustained and rising use in subsequent years.", "Question: Are high flow nasal cannulae noisier than bubble CPAP for preterm infants? Answer: At the gas flows studied, HFNC are not noisier than BCPAP for preterm infants.", "Question: BCRABL transcript detection by quantitative real-time PCR : are correlated results possible from homebrew assays? Answer: These", "Question: Aripiprazole: a new risk factor for pathological gambling? Answer: Adverse drug reactions were confronted with other already published case reports. Dopamine partial agonist mechanism of aripiprazole could explain the occurrence of pathological gambling.", "Question: Is the fibronectin-aggrecan complex present in cervical disk disease? Answer: Biochemical analysis of injured cervical intervertebral disks reveals the presence of inflammatory markers such as MCP, fragments of structural matrix proteins such as FAC, and a correlation with pH. Further evaluation of the FAC as a potential diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic target is warranted in the cervical spine.", "Question: Prostate bed target interfractional motion using RTOG consensus definitions and daily CT on rails : Does target motion differ between superior and inferior portions of the clinical target volume? Answer: There are no statistically apparent motion differences between SUP-CTV and INF-CTV. Current uniform planning target volume (PTV) margins are adequate to cover both portions of the CTV.", "Question: Advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma in Thai women: should we continue to offer second-look laparotomy? Answer: The second-look laparotomy doesn't have a favorable impact on overall and disease-free survival. Tumor grade is the only independent", "Question: Dose end-tidal carbon dioxide measurement correlate with arterial carbon dioxide in extremely low birth weight infants in the first week of life? Answer: There is good correlation and agreement between end-tidal CO(2) and arterial CO(2) in ELBW infants in the EtCO(2) range 30-50 mmHg. End-tidal CO(2) monitoring can be helpful in trending or for screening abnormal PaCO(2) values in ELBW infants in first week of life.", "Question: Neck pain treatment with acupuncture: does the number of needles matter? Answer: For this pathology, the number of needles, 5 or 11, seems not to be an important variable in determining the therapeutic effect when the time of stimulation is the same in the two groups.", "Question: Is zero central line-associated bloodstream infection rate sustainable? Answer: High-quality training, strict compliance with evidence-based guidelines, and thorough documentation is associated with significant reductions in CLABSIs. Mindful organizing may lead to a better understanding of what goes into a unit's ability to handle peak demands and sustain extraordinary performance in the long-term.", "Question: Is robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy less invasive than retropubic radical prostatectomy? Answer: This study showed for the first time that RALP induces lower tissue trauma than RRP.", "Question: Globulomaxillary cysts--do they really exist? Answer: According to the results of our study and the data from the international literature, the entity globulomaxillary cyst is no longer justified.", "Question: Is the advanced age a contraindication to GERD laparoscopic surgery? Answer: Laparoscopic antireflux surgery is a safe and effective treatment for GERD even in elderly patients, warranting low morbidity and mortality rates and a significant improvement of symptoms comparable to younger patients.", "Question: Does aerobic fitness influence microvascular function in healthy adults at risk of developing Type 2 diabetes? Answer: In this 'at-risk' group with skin microvascular dysfunction maximal oxygen uptake was not reduced compared with healthy controls. However, in the 'at-risk' group alone, individuals with higher levels of aerobic fitness also had better microvascular and endothelial responsiveness.", "Question: Estradiol and Antagonist Pretreatment Prior to Microdose Leuprolide in in Vitro Fertilization. Does It Improve IVF Outcomes in Poor Responders as Compared to Oral Contraceptive Pill? Answer: E2+antag pretreatment does not appear to improve IVF outcomes in ML protocol when compared to the standard OCP in poor responders. Randomized trials with adequate power to study the optimal method of steroid pretreatments appear justified.", "Question: Did the call for boycott by the Catholic bishops affect the polio vaccination coverage in Kenya in 2015? Answer: The", "Question: Is neck pain associated with worse health-related quality of life 6 months later? Answer: We found that neck pain was negatively associated with physical but not mental HRQoL. Our analysis suggests that neck pain may be a contributor of future poor physical HRQoL in the population. Raising awareness of the possible future impact of neck pain on physical HRQoL is important for health-care providers and policy makers with respect to the management of neck pain in populations.", "Question: Is decompressive surgery effective for spinal cord sarcoidosis accompanied with compressive cervical myelopathy? Answer: The effect of decompression for spinal cord sarcoidosis with compressive myelopathy was not evident. Early diagnosis for sarcoidosis from other organ and steroid therapy should be needed.", "Question: Can bedside assessment reliably exclude aspiration following acute stroke? Answer: Bedside assessment of swallowing lacks the necessary sensitivity to be used as a screening instrument in acute stroke, but there are concerns about the use of videofluoroscopy as a gold standard. The relative importance of aspiration and bedside assessment in predicting complications and outcome needs to be studied.", "Question: Does family practice at residency teaching sites reflect community practice? Answer: The residency training sites of the Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine provide patient care opportunities similar to those found in a national survey of family and general practitioners.", "Question: Is duration of psychological treatment for depression related to return into treatment? Answer: The results suggest that a longer duration of treatment may prevent return into mental health care in some groups. However, because of the design of the study, no causal inference can be drawn. Further research, preferably in a RCT, is needed to determine whether the trend towards lower intensity treatments is associated with repeated mental health care use.", "Question: Are increased carotid artery pulsatility and resistance indexes early signs of vascular abnormalities in young obese males? Answer: Our results suggest that depressed vessel compliance and increased vascular resistance are features of young, obese, normotensive subjects independently of and in addition to cardiovascular risk factors. As changes in arterial wall properties may be incipient in young obese subjects, future studies will be required to demonstrate whether early intervention such as diet and exercise in this population can improve vascular functions.", "Question: Can mental imagery functional magnetic resonance imaging predict recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness? Answer: The fMRI paradigm mental imagery displays a high concordance with the further clinical course of patients in a VS. All 5 patients in a VS who showed significant activation of ROIs had a favorable further course until the end of the observation period. We therefore propose the term \"functional minimally conscious state\" for these patients. They may benefit from rehabilitation treatment. In cases where no significant activation was seen, the method has no prognostic value. Prediction of the", "Question: Does the Simultaneous Use of a Neuroendoscope Influence the Incidence of Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Infection? Answer: In the present study, the use of an endoscope during VPS procedures did not increase the risk of surgical infection.", "Question: Can a Novel Surgical Approach to the Temporomandibular Joint Improve Access and Reduce Complications? Answer: The VMPA can provide direct access and favorable visibility to the TMJ region and yield good esthetic and functional results. The VMPA can be considered the approach of choice for common TMJ surgeries.", "Question: Does laparoscopic cholecystectomy influence peri-sinusoidal cell activity? Answer: Laparoscopic procedures caused detectable damage to Kupffer and endothelial cells as reflected by elevation of post-operative HA serum levels. The damage to the liver hepatocytes and perisinusoidal cells has no clinical significance and the laparoscopic procedure itself is the probable cause of the Kupffer and endothelial cells damage, while other mechanisms caused damage to the hepatocytes.", "Question: Do mossy fibers release GABA? Answer: We have thus provided compelling evidence that there is a mossy fiber GABAergic signal. The physiologic role of this mossy fiber GABAergic signal is uncertain, but may be of developmental importance. Other evidence suggests that this GABAergic signal is transiently upregulated after seizures. This could have an inhibitory or disinhibitory effect, and further work is needed to elucidate its actual role.", "Question: Reporting and interpreting red blood cell morphology: is there discordance between clinical pathologists and clinicians?
